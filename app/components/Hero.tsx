      After winning the lottery, I took some time to reflect on what it really means and how I want to move forward. I’ve come to a clear decision: I want to use this opportunity to support people in need.

Initially, I intended to stay completely private. However, I’ve realized that an opportunity like this can create real, meaningful change. Many people are facing difficult challenges, and if I’m in a position to help, I feel a responsibility to do so.
